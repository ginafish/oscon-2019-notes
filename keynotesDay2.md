# Oscon 2019 Day 2 Keynotes

## Adam Jacob - Chef - War for the soul of opensource
Open source companies are starting non-compete licenses
Possible customers -> channels (found, how they found) -> funnel (how it's sold to you) -> $$$
Open source is a channel, not a business, and that's kind of part of the problem
MongoDB got a list of spreadsheets of sales lost to Amazon
It's basically MongoDB, 8 billion dollar company, vs Amazon, 900 billion dollar company, to get their hand in your pocket
So their morale outrage is absurd

anti-996.icu < only restriction is that you can't use the license to violate labor law
free software foundation said it's not a free license and said not to use it

Basically, we all put in and take out from an infinite pool of 1's and 0's
Soul is what it means to you 


## Adrian Cockroft - AWS - 
### Market for open source
Originally, data centers with CIOs
Open source was being sold off of data center servers

### Where do open source businesses come from?
Community -> data center and github, offers support for the software
Developer community being used as a force multiplier for the software, and free training + way of hiring
Cloud based - leaving money on table
Enterprise - look too expensive
Cloud provider marketplace as force multiplier for sales reach

### Competing with the cloud
Preventing cloud providers from providing service via restrictive licenses is an "Ass backwards" strategy that cuts off developers from the community
Customers do want easy OSS use
"We really support MongoDB!!!"


##  VM Brasseur - Juniper Networks
We're obviously waiting with bated breath for the next thing from the multi-billion dollar fortune 500 company
Juniper is a Fortune 500ish company
Not a sponsored keynote
We have a lot of awesome tools built in large companies that have been released to us
Licenses cannot restrict based on fields of usage
"Free riders" - companies that use without contributing
Corporate involvement isn't perfect
Can't just bash all the companies without acknowledging that they do some good
If they're here to stay, we need to show how to do them right because if you don't, they will do it wrong
Welcome to the community, Microsoft!
Some companies are scared of the FOSS community because of how people react to companies misstep
What should we do?
    Give the companies that are doing it right the credit they deserve
    Listen to the companies' stories
    Keep your eye open for newcomers
    Use empathy (or just ethical manipulation, if you're not comfortable calling it empathy)

"Forge your future with open source"


## Roger Magoulas - O'Reilly
Radar - figure out what's going to change, spotting tech trends, trend analysis
Looked at proposals - holistic interest in cloud, data is central, community on the rise, and muuuuch in ML/AI, less on languages
Bias in data - much towards large companies
Top searches have seen less ML and Spark searches
Overall searches have ML and AI increases (the latter being used more)
Security searches on the rise
Strong correlation between Python and Java
Python mostly/very popular language for AI/ML
Kotlin and Rust on the rise


## Megan Byrd-Sanicki - Google
How to get people to use open source software?
    ##1 - Documentation!
But only 4% of contributers contribute to documentation
How to get people to write documentation?
    Have instructions, target first-time contributers, give templates, and thank them!
Google launching "Season of Docs" - paying tech writers to work on projects' documentation


## Pete Skomoroch - Workday
Current wave of AI/ML will be taking jobs
AI Products - automated systems that collect and learn from data to make user facing decisions w/ ML
ML engineers are publishing papers and contributing to OSS
paperswithcode.com
ML is still hard - don't know what models work, need tons of data, and can fail in unexpected ways, unpredictable development progress, past models difficult to reproduce
Need better tools - lots locked inside large companies
