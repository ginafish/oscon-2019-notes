# Oscon Keynotes Day 1

## Rachel and Kelley(?)
Intro

(Fire alarm!)


## Tiffani Ashley Bell - The Human Utility

Detroit having trouble with people getting water shut off due to not being able to pay (even if have cancer, etc)

Connect people who need help w/ water bills w/ people who wanna help

If wanna use software to help people for better living - start small.  Their original website was very very basic.

Re-imagine what we do.  Can build with just popsicle sticks (Google forms, bootstrap, etc)

Be thoughtful about the power of technologists.  Technology has huge impact. "Inspire better living through software"


## Kay Williams - Microsoft
Used to work on Linux and open source, now does it w/ Microsoft.  Times have changed...

OS makes developers happy!

No one company can really keep up to multiple companies working together

Most successful OS communities work best built from ground up thinking about OS community and customer use - ex: VSCode <3

OS also needs to create an environment that is a level playing field and that other companies can participate in

Code stability!

Microsoft still not trusted as a partner


## Paris Pittman - Google
Have been watching OS projects weather through seasons.  Many projects need statements backed up w/ intentions

OS gardening
* Make sure seed needs room to grow
* Code not enough to keep people involved.  Need to take care of gardeners (build and maintain community)


## IBM - using Open source to detect natural disasters

### Brad Topol - IBM
IBM distinguished engineer, developer advocate

Code response (name of that project)

IBM has a long history in open source

Had LotusGo webserver, proprietary webserver, was "gently put, terrible"

Decided to switch to Apache

Eclipse was originally proprietary

IBM helped w/ the moon landing

Call For Code - global challenge
* Project Owl - adhoc wifi duck network, spread it around, works after disaster


### Pedro Cruz
Call For Code winner, Puerto Rico resident

Communication took multiple months

SOS/aid messages were written in large text for helicopters to see

Pedro wrote "Drone Aid" - looks for those SOS messages


## Arun Gupta - AWS
Firecracker - virtual vm, changed serverless, etc

Amazon cares about OSS!

They like to take open source projects, build a service around it, because customers want them to help them innovate

AWS wants to have upstream compatability, so they contribute to a lot of OS projects, so that they don't have forks

Over 50% of kubernetes is run on AWS, and customers said they were having difficulties,


## Alison McCauley - Unblocked Future
Open source is now a foundation of culture - we now have open source surfboard plans and open source industrial equipment plans

Can we supercharge decentralized contribution?

We're doing more, but there's a lot more distractions nowadays

Quality of attention has been falling, while the cost has increased 7-9x - how do you get people to pay attention and take action? Answer: incentives

Time: 1,440 minutes per day

What if we had universal incentives?  Answer: blockchain ?!

Blockchain was created for bitcoin, and game theory helped grow it

Virtual currency being used to incentivize behavior

Can tag and register contribution, reward it, etc via blockchain

More that join in, more valuable token is

Blockchains are incentive machines

But money and open source don't seem to get along well

There's a project that is trying to make plastic in the ocean worth money, and people are doing it to earn digital coins that can be used for groceries

Swytch - accelerating sustainable growth

Dovu - making movement of people and goods more efficient and prolonging age of infrastructure
